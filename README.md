## Installation

In order to run the project locally, ensure that dependencies are installed by running:

`npm install`

<br />

## Usage

The project runs using the `npm start` script, allowing access to the API routes created for the User, Thought and Reaction Schema created in the models folder. The project allows for getting all, getting on, creating one, updating one and deleting for the User and Thought Schema, and creating and deleting one for the Reaction Schema and friend route based on the User schema. These routes can be viewed and tested through a secondary program, such as Insomnia Core or Postman.
